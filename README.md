## Project Introduction



[pandas-ai](https://github.com/sinaptik-ai/pandas-ai) is an AI based data analysis enhancement tool designed specifically for users who use Python and pandas for data processing and analysis. Support uploading CSV files for data analysis and Q&A, improving work efficiency. This product provides an out-of-the-box FaceNet based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system of Kunpeng servers.

## Core Features

- **Natural Language Interactive Data Analysis:** Users do not need to master SQL or Python, they only need to ask Chinese questions (such as "Which city has the highest sales volume?") to obtain accurate data insights, significantly reducing the threshold for data analysis
- **Deeply integrated with Huawei ModelArts MaaS platform:** Support secure calling of large models deployed on Huawei Cloud (such as DeepSeeker R1) through ` base_url ` and API Key, fully utilizing the capabilities of domestically produced AI infrastructure to ensure service stability and compliance
- **Lightweight Web Visualization Interface:** Quickly build an interactive front-end based on Streamlit, supporting file upload, question input, real-time response, and historical record display. The operation is simple and intuitive, suitable for non-technical users
- **Context aware intelligent reasoning:** The system automatically extracts the CSV header and the first few rows of data as context injection prompts, enabling the large model to accurately understand the table structure and generate reasonable answers
